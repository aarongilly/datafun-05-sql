    1.1. Document this schema in this README
2. Create a python script to create a database, define a schema, and insert records. 
3. Do additional operations - filter, query, insert, CRUD, modify the schema
4. Perform aggregations with queries
5. ...and potentially some other stuff. The spec indicates it is a work in progress.
